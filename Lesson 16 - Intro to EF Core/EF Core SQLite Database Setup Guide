# EF Cor SQLite Database Setup Guide

This guide is for starting a new visual studio solution from scratch and creating a database connection using EF Core.

It provides steps to migrate existing entities into a database.

## Steps
1. Install the following Nuget Packages:
    - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`
    - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite` 
    - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite.Design`
2. Create your entity classes.
3. Create a new Context class that inherits from DbContext.
4. In the Context class, for each Entity, create a new public DbSet<> property with standard get and set methods.
5. Override the OnConfiguring() method and include this line:
    ```
    optionsBuilder.UseSqlite("Data Source=yourDatabase.db");
    ```
    Replace "yourDatabase" with the actual name of your database
6. In the Main() method create a new Context class and then call the EnsureCreated() method on its Database Property. For example
    ```
    using var context = new MyDbContext();
    context.Database.EnsureCreated();
    ```
7. Build the solution.
8. The .db file can be found in `\bin\Debug\net10.0` directory of your solution.
